### Spring 2023

This will be the repository for my Honors Thesis on Support Vector Machines. The paper as well as the figures, references, data, and code will be uploaded. This thesis is due at the end of the 2023 Spring Semester and my advisor is **Dr. Jeremy Teitelbaum**. An example of a support vector machine from my paper is located below.
